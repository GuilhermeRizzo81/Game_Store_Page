##Game Store Page

This is a simple front-end project i made using HTML and CSS. It simulates a game store page for the game Project One III: Azure Butterfly REMAKE. It is not the entire website of the fictional game store (called Diamond Store), but i will be looking to do a more complex and big project soon. 

The project view is heavily inspired by Playstation Store´s layout, although i did not use any copyright restricted material.
